This is a suite of MATLAB files I wrote to perform image segmentation on microscope images to prepare data for the paper, https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4046986.

The image processing consisted of centroid detection, matrix rotation, scaling, edge detection with a combination of Canny's and Peter Kovesi's edge detection algorithms, and finally region filling.

A Word document was written describing the workflow for other users to help process images.
